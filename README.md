# SHRP2-NDS Driving Risk Analysis: Data Preparation & Modeling
This repository contains the Python code used in our study examining driver risk and safety-critical events (SCEs) using the SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study (SHRP2-NDS) dataset. The codebase includes scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling—particularly unsupervised anomaly detection using autoencoders.

⚠️ Note: The actual dataset used in this study is not included in this repository due to privacy and confidentiality constraints (PII protection). See the Data Access section below for more information.
